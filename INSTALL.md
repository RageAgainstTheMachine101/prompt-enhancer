### Step 2: Load in Chrome
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)

### Step 3: Configure Your n8n Webhook
1. Click the PromptEnhancer icon in Chrome toolbar

```

Response format:
```json
{
  "enhancedText": "Your improved text here"
}
```

2. Select some text you want to enhance
3. Click the "Enhance" button that appears

**Button not appearing?**
